Gregorian Calendar 1582 is a small Python script to generate calendars for any
year greater or equal to one. The output format is the same as the Unix "cal"
command. However, it supposes the Gregorian Reformation took place on October
4th, 1582, in contrast to the standard "cal" command, which in most systems
supposes the reformation took place on September 3rd, 1752.
